# GitHub CIDR Lookup CLI

This Go-based CLI fetches the latest IP ranges published by GitHub and lets you check whether an IPv4 or IPv6 address (or entire CIDR ranges) belongs to any GitHub-operated network segment (for example `hooks`, `web`, `api`, and more).

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or newer
- Internet access to reach `https://api.github.com/meta`

## Installation

### Install via `go install`

```sh
go install github.com/dav1dc-github/cidr-calculator-github@latest
```

This drops the `cidr-calculator-github` binary into `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` (or `GOBIN` if set); make sure that directory is on your `PATH`.

### Build from source

Clone the repository and download dependencies (none beyond the standard library are required):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dav1dc-github/cidr-calculator-github.git
cd cidr-calculator-github
```

## Usage

The CLI accepts both single IP addresses and CIDR notation inputs.

### Single IP Address Lookups

Run the CLI with one or more IP addresses as arguments:

```sh
go run . 192.30.252.44 140.82.113.3 8.8.8.8
```

Example output:

```text
Fetching GitHub IP ranges...
Loaded 123 CIDR blocks from GitHub.
192.30.252.44 -> owned by GitHub (hooks)
140.82.113.3 -> owned by GitHub (web)
8.8.8.8 -> not owned by GitHub (based on current meta data)
```

### CIDR Range Evaluation

You can also provide CIDR notation to evaluate entire IP ranges. The tool will iterate through all addresses in the range (up to a threshold) and provide aggregated results:

```sh
go run . 192.30.252.0/30
```

Example output:

```text
Fetching GitHub IP ranges...
Loaded 123 CIDR blocks from GitHub.
192.30.252.0/30 -> evaluated 4 addresses:
  - Owned by GitHub: 4
  - Not owned: 0
  - Label distribution:
    - api,hooks: 4 addresses
```

For mixed ownership:

```sh
go run . 185.199.110.0/24
```

```text
185.199.110.0/24 -> evaluated 256 addresses:
  - Owned by GitHub: 256
  - Not owned: 0
  - Label distribution:
    - pages: 256 addresses
```

### IPv6 Support

Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and CIDR ranges are fully supported:

```sh
go run . 2001:db8:1::213 2001:db8:1::/126
```

Example output:

```text
2001:db8:1::213 -> owned by GitHub (hooks)
2001:db8:1::/126 -> evaluated 4 addresses:
  - Owned by GitHub: 4
  - Not owned: 0
  - Label distribution:
    - hooks: 4 addresses
```

### Threshold Behavior

To prevent excessive processing, CIDR ranges are limited to a maximum of **4,096 addresses** by default. Larger ranges will trigger a warning and skip evaluation:

```sh
go run . 192.168.0.0/16
```

```text
192.168.0.0/16 -> CIDR range too large (65536 addresses, threshold is 4096). Skipping evaluation.
Warning: Large CIDR ranges are not evaluated. Consider using a more specific range or adding a --limit flag in future versions.
```

Special cases:
- `/32` (IPv4) and `/128` (IPv6) prefixes contain exactly one address and are evaluated normally
- Ranges with exactly 4,096 addresses (e.g., `/20` for IPv4) are evaluated
- Ranges with more than 4,096 addresses are skipped with a warning

### Interactive Mode

If you call the binary without arguments it enters an interactive mode:

```sh
go run .
```

```text
Fetching GitHub IP ranges...
Loaded 123 CIDR blocks from GitHub.
Enter an IP address to check (type 'exit' to quit):
> 185.199.108.153
185.199.108.153 -> owned by GitHub (pages)
> 192.30.252.0/30
192.30.252.0/30 -> evaluated 4 addresses:
  - Owned by GitHub: 4
  - Not owned: 0
  - Label distribution:
    - api,hooks: 4 addresses
> exit
```

The interactive mode accepts:
- Single IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6)
- CIDR notation (IPv4 or IPv6)
- `exit` or `quit` commands (case-insensitive) to terminate

Once installed via `go install`, you can run the compiled binary directly:

```sh
cidr-calculator-github 192.30.252.45
```

## Building a standalone binary

```sh
go build -o github-ip-checker
./github-ip-checker 140.82.114.4
```

## Testing

```sh
go test ./...
```

## Notes

- The tool queries the GitHub meta API on startup; subsequent lookups are performed locally without additional network calls.
- Matching is performed against the CIDR ranges published by GitHub. If an address is not listed, it may still belong to GitHub if their public ranges change between releasesâ€”rerun the CLI to refresh the data.
- Responses are cached under your OS cache directory (for example, `~/Library/Caches/cidr-calculator-github` on macOS). The CLI reuses cached metadata via the ETag header, reducing bandwidth while still refreshing when GitHub publishes new ranges. Delete the cache directory to force a full refetch.
